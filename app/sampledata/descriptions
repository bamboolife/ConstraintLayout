When the whole world is about to rain, let’s make it clear in our heart together.
Time goes by so fast, people go in and out of your life. You must never miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you.
One needs 3 things to be truly happy living in the world: some thing to do, some one to love, some thing to hope for.
No matter how bad your heart has been broken, the world doesn’t stop for your grief. The sun comes right back up the next day.
Until you make peace with who you are, you’ll never be content with what you have.
I’ll think of you every step of the way.
